## Welcome to Yiming's Homepage!

Hi! I'm Yiming Wang, a second-year master student in Data Science at Harvard University. I got my undergraduate degree from PKU EECS, majoring in Computer Science. I'm doing research in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Large Language Model (LLM)**. I'm really fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Kai-Wei Chang](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/) in UCLA, Prof. [Tao Yu](https://taoyds.github.io/) in HKU and Prof. [Baobao Chang](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1181/1543.htm) in PKU.


## Research Interests

* **Evaluation of language models:** identify their strengths and weaknesses, paving way for further improvements

* **Human-AI Collaboration:** build robust, communicative language model (framework) that communicates, collaborates with human, and solves real-world problems for human. 

Please check my [CV](https://rubywong123.github.io/cv/) for more details!
